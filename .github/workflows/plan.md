# GitHub Actions Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Basic CI
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows` directory structure
- [ ] Create initial `main.yml` for basic CI pipeline
  - [ ] Configure triggers for main and develop branches
  - [ ] Set up JDK 21 environment
  - [ ] Implement Maven build and test step
  - [ ] Document configuration with comments
- [ ] Test and verify CI pipeline
- [ ] Document first CI checkpoint

## Phase 2: Docker Integration and CD
- [ ] Add Docker Hub secrets to GitHub repository
  - [ ] DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
  - [ ] DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
- [ ] Extend pipeline for Docker operations
  - [ ] Add Docker login step
  - [ ] Configure Docker build steps for:
    - [ ] Backend API
    - [ ] Database
    - [ ] HTTPD
  - [ ] Implement conditional push to Docker Hub
- [ ] Test and verify Docker builds
- [ ] Document CD checkpoint

## Phase 3: Quality Gate Implementation
- [ ] Set up SonarCloud integration
  - [ ] Create SonarCloud organization
  - [ ] Get project and organization keys
  - [ ] Add SONAR_TOKEN to GitHub secrets
- [ ] Add SonarCloud analysis step to pipeline
- [ ] Configure quality gates
- [ ] Test and verify SonarCloud integration
- [ ] Document quality gate checkpoint

## Phase 4: Pipeline Optimization
- [ ] Split workflows for better organization
  - [ ] Create separate workflow for testing
  - [ ] Create separate workflow for Docker builds
  - [ ] Implement workflow dependencies
- [ ] Configure branch-specific triggers
  - [ ] Test workflow on develop branch
  - [ ] Docker push workflow on main branch only
- [ ] Document final pipeline structure

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Document each phase in commit messages
- [ ] Add comments in workflow files
- [ ] Create README section for CI/CD setup
- [ ] Document security considerations
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Checkpoints
1. First CI with backend test
2. Working CI & Docker images pushed to repository
3. Working quality gate
4. Optimized split pipelines

## Questions to Address
1. What are testcontainers? (2-1)
2. Why use secured variables? (2-2)
3. Why use needs: build-and-test-backend? (2-3)
4. Why push Docker images? (2-4)
